Process:
Data Cleaning: You've handled missing values effectively by imputing them with appropriate statistics (mode for categorical features and mean for numerical features).

Encoding Categorical Variables: You've converted categorical variables into numerical form using OrdinalEncoder, which is appropriate for this task. Make sure to check if any feature might need different encoding or scaling techniques based on the model requirements.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Naive Bayes: You've implemented a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and obtained:
Precision: 0.777
Recall: 0.952
Accuracy: 0.780
These metrics indicate that your model has a good recall (low false negatives) but somewhat lower precision. Consider whether this trade-off suits your use case.
SVM with Grid Search: Youâ€™ve performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for an SVM with RBF kernel. The output indicates that C=1 and gamma=0.1 might be good parameters based on the cross-validation scores. Check the final performance of the SVM model on the test set to compare with Naive Bayes.
Visualizations: The bar chart for loan approval status by gender is a good start. Consider adding more visualizations to explore other features and their impact on loan approval. For example, scatter plots for numerical features against loan status could be insightful.

Feature Importance: Since you're working with a classification problem, you might also want to explore feature importance with models like Random Forest or XGBoost to better understand which features most influence the loan approval decision.

Additional Models: Consider experimenting with other classifiers like Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, or Ensemble Methods to see if they improve performance compared to Naive Bayes and SVM.
